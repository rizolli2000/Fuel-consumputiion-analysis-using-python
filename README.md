# Fuel-consumputiion-analysis-using-python
This project aims to analyze fuel consumption data using Python. It provides a set of tools and scripts to process fuel consumption data, visualize trends, and perform statistical analysis.

Features
Data Import: The project includes scripts to import fuel consumption data from various file formats such as CSV (Comma-Separated Values) or Excel files. It handles common data cleaning tasks, such as removing duplicates and handling missing values.

Data Visualization: The project offers tools to visualize fuel consumption data through charts and graphs. It includes functions to plot trends over time, compare different vehicles' consumption, and generate insights from the data.

Statistical Analysis: The project leverages Python's statistical libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas, to perform statistical analysis on the fuel consumption data. It calculates key metrics such as average consumption, standard deviation, and fuel efficiency.

Data Filtering and Aggregation: The project allows users to filter and aggregate fuel consumption data based on various criteria, such as vehicle type, time period, or driving conditions. This functionality helps in isolating specific subsets of data for further analysis.

Reporting and Exporting: The project enables generating comprehensive reports summarizing the fuel consumption analysis results. It supports exporting the results in different formats, such as HTML, PDF, or Excel, for easy sharing and collaboration.

Requirements
To use this project, you need to have the following:
